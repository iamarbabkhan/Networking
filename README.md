### Protocol
1. Network Layer Protocols:
- Internet Protocol (IP): The fundamental protocol for addressing and routing packets across a network.
- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): Used for error reporting and diagnostics.
2. Transport Layer Protocols:
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP): Offers faster, connectionless communication with minimal overhead.
3. Application Layer Protocols:
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Used for web browsing.
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP): Facilitates file transfers between computers.
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): Manages email transmissions.
- Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): Used for retrieving emails from a server.
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP): Manages and monitors network devices.
- Domain Name System (DNS): Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
4. Data Link Layer Protocols:
- Ethernet: Common protocol for local area networks (LANs).
- Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP): Used for establishing a direct connection between two nodes.
5. Physical Layer Protocols:
- Universal Serial Bus (USB): Connects devices using cables and connectors.
- Bluetooth: Enables short-range wireless communication between devices.
6. Routing Protocols:
- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF): Used for routing within an autonomous system.
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): Routes data between different autonomous systems on the internet.
7. Security Protocols:
- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS): Encrypts data for secure communication over the internet.
- IPsec (Internet Protocol Security): Ensures secure communication at the network layer.
8. Wireless Protocols:
- Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11): Enables wireless local area networking.
- Bluetooth: Used for short-range wireless communication between devices.
9. VoIP Protocols:
- Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Initiates, modifies, and terminates communication sessions in VoIP.
- Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP): Transmits audio and video in real-time communication.
### Ip Address
a unique numerical identifier for every device or network that connects to the internet.

#### Types: IPv4 and IPv6
- IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical addresses
- IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numerical addresses
### Subnetting/Subnet
dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.
### CIDR(classless inter domain routing)
CIDR notation, an IP address is followed by a forward slash "/"
### Port
A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end.
### Routing
Routing involves directing network traffic between different networks.
